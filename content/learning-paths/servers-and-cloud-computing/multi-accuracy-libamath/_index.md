title: Using Multiaccuracy Vector Functions in amath

minutes_to_complete: 20
author: Joana Cruz

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers who want to learn how to use multi-accuracy feature present in libamath, a component of ArmPL. This feature was introduced in ArmPl 25.04.

learning_objectives: 
    - How accuracy is defined by libamath
    - What accuracies are available
    - How to pick accuracy according to application

# [libamath](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101004/2504/, (component of [ArmPL (Arm Performance Libraries)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101004/2504/General-information/Arm-Performance-Libraries?lang=en)). Since libamath only provides vector functions on Linux, we assume you are working in a Linux environment where ArmPL is installed (meaning you completed [ArmPL's installation guide](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/armpl/).)

prerequisites:
    - An Arm computer running Linux
    - Build and install [ArmPL](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/armpl/)
